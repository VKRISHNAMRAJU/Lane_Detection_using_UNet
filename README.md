# LANE DETECTION USING UNET
Lane detection is a crucial computer vision task that involves identifying the boundaries of driving lanes in an image or video of a road scene. It plays a vital role in various applications, particularly in the realm of autonomous vehicles and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).  Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are now the dominant approach for lane detection. Trained on large datasets of road images, these models can achieve high accuracy even in challenging situations.  In this we implemented UNET architecture which is a deep learning algorithm widely used for image segmentation.
## UNET
U-Net is a powerful, versatile neural network architecture specifically designed for semantic segmentation tasks, which involve dividing an image into different meaningful regions. Lane detection in self-driving cars is a perfect example of a semantic segmentation task, where the goal is to accurately identify and segment the lanes in a road image.  UNET has the ability to extract line features and the ability to extract context improves the accuracy of lane lines. The experimental results show that the improved neural network can obtain good detection performance in complex lane lines, and effectively improve the accuracy and time-sensitives of lane lines.

## TuSimple Dataset
The TuSimple dataset is a large-scale dataset for autonomous driving research, focusing on lane detection and perception tasks. It's widely used in computer vision and autonomous driving communities for benchmarking and developing algorithms.

The TuSimple dataset consists of 6,408 road images on US highways. The resolution of image is 1280Ã—720. The dataset is composed of 3,626 for training, 358 for validation, and 2,782 for testing called the TuSimple test set of which the images are under different weather conditions.
